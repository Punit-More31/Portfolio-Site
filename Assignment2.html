            <span><b>1."Siloscape" Malware:- June 14, 2021</b><br><span>
            <span><b>Virus Type: Malware Targeting Windows Containers</b><br><span>
            <span> It has been reported that a new category of malware is targeting misconfigured Kubernetes clusters through Windows containers to compromise cloud environments. The malware variant gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in common cloud applications or a vulnerable web page or database and then utilizes windows container escape techniques, executes code on underlying node and then spreads in poorly configured Kubernetes clusters to open a backdoor in order to run/deploy malicious containers. Once cluster is compromised, the attacker might be able to steal critical information such as usernames and passwords, an organizations confidential and internal files or even entire databases hosted in the cluster. This malware can leverage the computing resources in a Kubernetes cluster for crypto-jacking and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data from hundreds of applications running in the compromised clusters.</span>

            <span> It has been reported that a new ransomware named "Sarbloh" is spreading via specially crafted malicious documents sent as spear phishing email attachments. Malicious document is embedded with Marco with a heavily obfuscated VBA code, which downloads original payload (Sarbloh Ransomware) from an AWS URL silently. Once executed, it encrypts files on affected system (Audio, images, video, databases, and other document files) and renames the encrypted files with the ".sarbloh" extension to make them unusable. The ransom note ("README_SARBLOH.txt") states that the user's files are encrypted and will not be recovered until Sarbloh's creator's demands are fulfilled.</span>
